            <h5>Why Somnia?</h5>
            <h2>Somnia, a cozy place to recreate your fantasies</h2>
            <p>
              Founded 15 days before a global pandemic. Daniel Arevalo and Jota
              the Magician fuse the art of cocktails and magic to create a
              unique place in the bowels of Barcelona.
            </p>
            <p>
              Somnia is a signature cocktail bar set in a twentieth century fair
              with nods to the circus of the same era. We immerse the client in
              a magical atmosphere created by the decoration of the place, the
              spectacular cocktails, both the service and the taste. And of
              course, the magic show table by table every day. The goal is to
              make Somnia a reference point for cocktails and illusionism in
              Barcelona.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hospitality, comfort and the wow effect for our customers are our
              number one priority.

                  When he was afraid he would always visit her. The witch looked
                  at him with empathy and a smile, she already knew why Joe went
                  to her. - ‚ÄúAgain that ridiculous dream.‚Äù
                  <br />
                  Joe said worriedly pretending that he wasn't. - Ridiculous?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dreaming of a caged monkey can mean that your ego is
                  repressed, trapped by social conventions. If you've tried to
                  get the monkey out of the cage, there are aspects of your
                  personality that will surface in no time. You fear looking
                  ridiculous.

                  -Do you think you are very brave? I smell your fear.

                <p>
                  - A thousand different ingredients, a hundred years of
                  maturation, a ritual known only to my ancestors and a small
                  display of affection. It's the only thing you need to seduce
                  her, Joe - said the witch. He gulped down that delicious
                  concoction as if he hadn't drunk in days, but without spilling
                  a single drop.
                  <br />
                  - Thanks again, Witch.
                  <br />
                  She knows more about the devil for being old than for being
                  the devil. The witch knew that the connection Mia and Joe had
                  went far beyond potions. Joe just needed the ingredient that
                  all of our concoctions have: Disinhibition
